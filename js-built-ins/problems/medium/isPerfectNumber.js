/*
  Write a function `isPerfectNumber` which takes an integer `num` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the number is a perfect number.

  What is a perfect number?
  - A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.

  Example:
  - Input: 6
  - Output: true
    - Explanation: The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.
  
  - Input: 28
  - Output: true
    - Explanation: The divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, so 28 is a perfect number.

  - Input: 10
  - Output: false
    - Explanation: The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, and 5. 1 + 2 + 5 = 8, which is not equal to 10, so 10 is not a perfect number.

  - Input: 1
  - Output: false
    - Explanation: The divisors of 1 are none (it doesn't have proper divisors), so 1 is not a perfect number.

  Once you've implemented the logic, test your code by running
  - `npm run test-perfect`

function isPerfectNumber(num) {
  let sum=0;
  for(let i=1;i<=num/2;i++){
    if(num%i===0) sum+=i;
  }
  return sum===num;
  // Your code here
}

module.exports = { isPerfectNumber };
