/*
  Write a function `countOccurrences` which takes an array as input and returns an object representing the frequency of each element in the array.

  What is frequency?
  - The frequency of an element is the number of times it appears in the array.

  Example:
  - Input: [10, 20, 10, 30, 20, 20]
  - Output: { 10: 2, 20: 3, 30: 1 }

  - Input: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1]
  - Output: { 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1 }

  - Input: []
  - Output: {}

  Once you've implemented the logic, test your code by running
  - `npm run test-occurrences`

    return res;
  }

      res[arr[i]] += 1;
    } else {
      res[arr[i]] = 1;
